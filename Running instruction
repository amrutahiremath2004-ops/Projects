Step 1: Create Project Folder

Create a folder for project, e.g., HR_Assistant. Inside it, create two files:

server.js → Node.js backend

index.html →frontend HTML

Directory structure:

HR_Assistant/
├── server.js
└── index.html



Step 2: Install Node.js Dependencies

Open a terminal in your project folder (HR_Assistant).

Initialize npm:

npm init -y

Install required packages:

npm install express cors



Step 3: Run the Backend Server

In your terminal:

node server.js

You should see:

HR Assistant running on http://localhost:3000


Step 4: Open Frontend

Open index.html in your browser (double-click the file or use VS Code “Open with Live Server”).

You should see the chatbot interface.

Type questions like:

"leave policy"

"benefits"

"salary"

Your backend will respond with predefined HR answers.



Step 5: Test

Type "leave policy" → should reply with leave details.

Type "benefits" → should reply with company benefits.

Type unknown question → should reply:

Sorry, I don't have information about that.
